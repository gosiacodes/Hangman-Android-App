# :sparkles: Hangman Android App :sparkles:
Android App "Hangman Game" with timer - school project at Mobile Development with Java course (2020)

## :pushpin: _How does the application work?_

You guess the word like in every Hangman game (comes random from array with 35 words).

You can see which letters you tried, how many tries you have left 

and check the Hangman progress with pictures.

When you loose or win, animation with corresponding text shows.

You can also play with timer (1 minute) with start, reset, pause and resume.

There is also reset game possibility.
